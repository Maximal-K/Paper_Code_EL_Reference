# EL Code Reference

This code set serves as the reference code for all images in the paper "Solving the Compact Lower Bound of Gaussian Q Function by Simple Inversion Algorithm and its Application in Coherent Optical Communication". For the paperâ€™s detailed information, please see the website "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8353222".



The code shown basically covers all the images in the original paper, but one boundary is not shown. This column refers to the original author's code, not written by me or the author of this article. In addition, this code does not mean that the images in the original paper have a high probability of error. Since this line was added after the editor's comments, my tutor and first author did not ask for a check. I also asked the first author. Because the author of that bound gave the source code directly, and the first author didn't feel the need to check it either. When sorting out the paper code in November 2024, I re-checked the code of the original paper and found that my figure was inconsistent with the original paper because the source code used a different horizontal coordinate boundary.



The codes shown are done by Maximal-K, not by the team.
